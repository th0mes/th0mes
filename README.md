## 👋 Hey, I'm Thiago

I'm a mid-level full stack developer with a strong passion for frontend. I currently work with **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Node.js**, but lately I've been diving deep into **Rust** and really enjoying the challenge.

### 🧠 What drives me

I love building real solutions for real people. Seeing a project actually running and making a difference is what keeps me going. I'm always chasing that "aha" moment.

I'm the kind of person who enjoys digging into the details of JavaScript, understanding how things work under the hood. But learning Rust has been a whole new level. Sometimes I feel like I know nothing, and that's exactly what makes it fun. It forces me to grow.

Right now, I'm focused on improving my fundamentals by studying:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Software architecture
- Design patterns
- System design

To really get it, I’ve been building things from scratch — my own shell, a simple database, and whatever else helps me understand how computers work at a deeper level.

### 💼 Experience

I've been working professionally since **2021**, and along the way I've had my fair share of adventures with **PHP**, **jQuery**, **AngularJS**, and even some less joyful moments with **Angular**, **C#**, and **Visual Basic**.

### 🛠️ Tools I use often
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- React / Next.js
- Node.js / Express
- Rust (currently learning)
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- Docker, Linux, Git

### 🧪 Currently exploring
- Systems programming with Rust
- LeetCode and CS fundamentals
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable, and more performant code
